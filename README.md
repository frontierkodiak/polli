# Modern intelligence tools for biodiversity. 
Polli is techincal infrastructure for multiplying the effectiveness of the world's ecologists. Polli's biodiversity sensors radically reduce the cost of data, making possible the expansive, continuous studies needed to address global biodiversity declines. Polli ultimately aims to make possible for insects the kind of data-driven interventions that have stemmed declines among birds and mammals.

# This repository
Core user-facing components shared by the Polli family of biodiversity tools. This repository will in size &amp; scope as I open-source additional components.

Though this repo is the basis of polli-bird, some components will be sporadically backported. For now, I'm prioritizing the pace of my development. I'll commit to a more formal Git flow when I start collaborating with others. Until then, this repo mainly exists to remind myself to manage complexity by writing Polli with modularity in mind.
